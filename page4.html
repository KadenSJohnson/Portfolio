                Utah Valley University’s Student Leadership and Success Studies.
                Quite a mouthful of name for a department. The department
                focuses on classes around soft skills such as leadership, stress
                management, and major/career exploration. As a team with 4 other
                Web Design and Development students were assigned the task of
                helping redesign their website. We competed against other teams
                of classmates for which redesign the client (the head of the
                department) would like best.

              <h3>Department lacked recognition, website has not main CTA</h3>
              <p>
                We found from student surveys and interviews and client
                interviews that the main problems facing the UVU SLSS was that
                they lacked a lot of recognition for their classes. Students had
                often heard of some of the classes they offered but didn’t
                understand the connection to the wider department.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our first idea was that the website needed to capitalize on
                these classes that students already knew about. Our assumption
                was that the current site didn’t explain what SLSS was or what
                they had to offer. We wanted to study what people understood
                from their current website before we jumped into the designs to
                see if our assumptions were right.
              </p>

              <p>
                We performed eye tracking tests and user interviews which proved
                most of our assumptions were correct. Users had a hard time
                finding the classes they offered and how to sign up for them.
                Users didn’t understand the mission statement of the department
                and had a hard time finding what the department was really
                about.

            <h3>Wireframes sitemap and Design Critique</h3>
            <p>
              After our research was completed we got into some designing we
              went through the typical site map and whiteboard wireframes and
              then ideating on some of the ideas. We broke out some of the pages
              into similar ideas and assigned them to group members. The main
              page I was assigned was the landing page.
            </p>

            <p>
              We received feedback in class from our professor and our peers
              about our designs and then made some initial surface comps and
              then again did another design review and got some more feedback
              which got us to our final design ready to present.

            The Results - a new landing page with a clear CTA and better
            hierarchy
          </h3>
          <p>
            The landing page was my main focus as its the initial impression of
            the visitors of the site and would be the draw to have them explore
            more of the site. Our landing page was first focused on the main
            call to action which we decided should be meeting with a advisor
            because from our research we found that besides hearing from family
            and friends, advisors were the biggest reason students took SLSS
            classes. I decided to use UVU’s card components pretty heavily in my
            design to show some of SLSS offerings. This gave the site some
            actionable items and helped students better understand what SLSS was
            all about.

          <h3>Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            We presented our designs to the clients along with the other teams
            here is what the clients had to say about our designs.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Probably my favorite presentation. I really like how you used the
            data, the design of the site, the rationale, etc. Knocked it out of
            the park!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall this was a great project working with a real client, having
            to work with a team, and competing against other teams. In the end
            we were selected with another team to hand off our designs to the
            development class which I wasn’t a part of but as far as I know is
            currently in development.

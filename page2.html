              <p>
                For the past 2+ years I have been working as an part time UX
                Designer/Developer at Smart Vision Works, a A.I. Food inspection
                company. I spent a lot of time getting my roots as a designer.
                To help show the many different things I worked on during my
                time there, I have a few short stories to help illustrate the
                many projects or features I worked during my time there.

              <h3>Design Conventions</h3>
              <p>
                When I first started designing at Smart Vision Works (SVW) I did
                a content audit to list all colors, other styles like button
                types and when they were used. From this audit I found we lacked
                much needed consistency across products and even within the same
                product with design decisions.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the steps to help find a solution to this inconsistency
                that I took was create an easier to use pallet for our
                developers. I used Material Design 2’s color guidelines in
                creating our colors and made a SCSS file that could be shared
                globally for our developers. I then added it into the theme of
                all our projects UI libraries and went through making sure all
                the colors used in our code base used colors from this file.
              </p>

              <p>
                To help our developers use these colors efficiently, I updated
                our design guidelines to include how and when to use the colors
                and how to import and use the SCSS file in projects. This helped
                speed up development by reducing time for developers to think
                about which color should be used. This also helped our products
                look the same when jumping between products.

              <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>
                A lot of the work I did at the beginning of my time at SVW was
                getting common design standards met things like proper contrast
                ratios, layout, color choices, etc. We had already improved the
                product a lot by just going off typical standards/conventions
                but to improve any further we had to start involving our
                customers in our design decisions more.
              </p>

              <p>
                I conducted a usability study on 4 features I identified as key
                or highly used. I was able to tag along with one of our salesman
                on a trip to visit some of our customers and get a lot of great
                information about our products. I won’t dive into detail here
                but one of the main things I found is our customers struggled
                with making sizing classes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Part of SVW’s product uses machine learning to identify the
                height width and weight of produce in this case potatoes.
                Customers are able to edit ranges of the weight of the produce
                and later then determine how a specific range of that size of
                potatoes should be sorted. Part of the usability test was
                watching how our customers edited and used these sizes. I found
                an overwhelming majority of our customers struggled with this
                basic key feature. I found it was due to an error in our UI
                library and how it was originally designed.
              </p>

              <h3>The Redesign</h3>
              <p>
                Here is the redesign of this modal, we fixed the issue with the
                colors and made it very obvious what was clickable by removing
                the border. We also got rid of the number because we found that
                customers didn’t use it anyway. We renamed note to language that
                was more commonly used by our customer for what they were
                already calling it.
              </p>
            </div>

          <div class="study-section">
            <div class="study-text">
              <h3>Continued Work</h3>
              <p>
                The next step that I can’t report results on yet, the next step
                is testing the change with customers. The goal is to reduce the
                time for users to make and edit sizes. We also want to reduce
                confusion when we interview customers about this feature.
              </p>

              <p>
                This was what you would call a small but mighty change. Small in
                that it didn’t take a lot of work to fix and it seemed
                insignificant, but mighty because it shows our customers we care
                about making their products better and care about their
                experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am currently still working here work with SVW to improve our
                products every day. The next improvement we are working on is
                setting up more user research and user analytics tracking. Feel
                free to ask me about what I am working on right now.

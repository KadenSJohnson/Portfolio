            <h1>Smart Vision Works</h1>
            <h2>Helping developers keep users in mind</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="study-section"><h3>Introduction </h3>
        <p>For the past 2+ years I have been working as an part time UX Designer/Developer at Smart Vision Works,
             a A.I. Food inspection company. I spent a lot of time getting my roots as a designer.
              To help show the many different things I worked on during my time there, 
              I have a few short stories to help illustrate the many projects or features I worked during my time there. </p></div>

        <div class="study-section"><h3>Design Conventions </h3>
        <p>When I first started designing at Smart Vision Works (SVW) 
            I did a content audit to list all colors, other styles like button 
            types and when they were used. From this audit I found we lacked much needed 
            consistency across products and even within the same product with design decisions. </p>

            <p>One of the steps to help find a solution to this inconsistency that I took was create an easier 
                to use pallet for our developers. I used Material Design 2’s color guidelines in creating our colors and made a 
                SCSS file that could be shared globally for our developers. I then added it into the theme of all our projects 
                UI libraries and went through making sure all the colors used in our code base used colors from this file. </p>
            
            <p>To help our developers use these colors efficiently, I updated our design guidelines to include how and when 
                to use the colors and how to import and use the SCSS file in projects. This helped speed up development by 
                reducing time for developers to think about which color should be used. This also helped our products look the 
                same when jumping between products.  </p>
            
            </div>

            <div class="study-section"><h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>A lot of the work I did at the beginning of my time at SVW was getting common design standards met things 
                    like proper contrast ratios, layout, color choices, etc. We had already improved the product a lot by just 
                    going off typical standards/conventions but to improve any further we had to start involving our customers 
                    in our design decisions more.  </p>
                
                <p>I conducted a usability study on 4 features I identified as key or highly used. I was able to tag along with
                     one of our salesman on a trip to visit some of our customers and get a lot of great information about our products.
                      I won’t dive into detail here but one of the main things I found is our customers struggled with making sizing classes. </p>

                <p>Part of SVW’s product uses machine learning to identify the height width and weight of produce
                     in this case potatoes. Customers are able to edit ranges of the weight of the produce and later
                      then determine how a specific range of that size of potatoes should be sorted. Part of the 
                      usability test was watching how our customers edited and used these sizes. I found an overwhelming
                       majority of our customers struggled with this basic key feature. I found it was due to an error in our UI library 
                       and how it was originally designed. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="study-section">
                    
                    <img src="/images/gallery2/Shots Create Mockups (10).png" alt="">

                    <p>Here is the redesign of this modal, we fixed the issue with the colors and made 
                    it very obvious what was clickable by removing the border. We also got rid of the
                    number because we found that customers didn’t use it anyway. We renamed note to 
                    language that was more commonly used by our customer for what they were already calling it.</p> 
                </div>

                <div class="study-section">
                
                    <h3>Continued Work</h3>
                    </p>The next step that I can’t report results on yet, the next step is testing the change with customers.
                     The goal is to reduce the time for users to make and edit sizes. We also want to reduce confusion when 
                     we interview customers about this feature.</p>

                    </p>This was what you would call a small but mighty change. Small in that it didn’t take a lot of work to 
                    fix and it seemed insignificant, but mighty because it shows our customers we care about making their products
                     better and care about their experience. </p>

                    </p>I am currently still working here work with SVW to improve our products every day. 
                    The next improvement we are working on is setting up more user research and user analytics tracking. 
                    Feel free to ask me about what I am working on right now.</p>

              <h3>Design competition for a community building event app.</h3>
              <p>
                UVU’s product design club hosted a design competition called
                “Design 2 Delivered.” The goal of the competition being to have
                a local business get design guidance from a team of students.
                With a team of 4 other we won the competition judged by a panel
                of 2 business owners and our professors.
              </p>

              <p>
                The local business we designed for, TagAlong, was several months
                away from their launch of their app.
                <strong
                  >They gave 3 goals 15,000 users, increase user engagement and
                  retention, and enhancing the UX experience with a budget of
                  10,000 dollars.</strong

              </p>

              <p>
                TagAlong is an app to meet new people doing events such as
                hiking, ice climbing, movie nights, etc. Very similar to Bumble
                Friends or Facebook groups but with some additional features,
                such as carpool organizer, flake score (sort out flakey people),
                and advanced sort of who comes to events.

              <h3>Finding pain points and early assumptions</h3>
              <p>
                Our first meeting as a team we all had the opportunity to use to
                their beta app and make a list of problems we saw, bugs we
                noticed, and create some early assumptions of ways we would
                solve them. We used these early assumptions as ways to guide
                what to research and what questions we needed to ask.
              </p>

              <p>
                I came up with our team name “team get in get out”.
                <strong
                  >We wanted the users to be able to get into the app quickly
                  and get to an event and get out there.</strong
                >
                The real value and what we believe will keep new users is having
                value they can’t get from anywhere else. If the users have a
                hard time getting to an event they won’t use the app. So that
                being the main focus of our changes we were ready to problem
                solve.

              <h3>Testing our assumptions to find our pain points</h3>
              <p>
                Based on our initial assumptions we thought the onboarding took
                too long so we tested similar apps
                <strong>
                  we found the app averaged over 2:00 minutes than similar
                  apps.</strong
                >
                We redesigned a simpler version that was more visually
                interesting.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another assumption we had was their text message (their main way
                to share events with people without the app) lacked visual
                interest. We tested this with making our own version with
                shorter, better copy and a image from the event.
                <strong>We conducted interviews and eye tracking</strong> I
                think the previous design could be fit into this one quote from
                one of the interviews.
                <strong
                  >“When I saw the long link and text I thought it was a
                  scam”</strong
                >
                and the new design could be summarized with this quote “I would
                go to that event”
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong
                  >We found a design issue with one of their main call to
                  actions.</strong
                >
                On the page to join or decline going to an event<strong>
                  the buttons were so circular people didn’t know they were
                  buttons.</strong
                >
                We tested this with user interview and usability tests. After we
                were sure it was the button shape we made a change in the design
                of the buttons and then did an eye tracking test to make sure.

              <h3>Our pitch to the business owners</h3>
              <p>
                UI changes wasn’t the only thing we suggested to do. Our
                business/marketing plan was mostly inspired from a quote by Paul
                Graham from Y-Combinator “The most common unscalable thing
                founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually.
                Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to
                you. You have to go out and get them.”
              </p>

              <p>
                We decided that to have a successful launch and to help their
                users “Get in Get Out” They needed to have professional events
                for the users to get out to. We came up with some event
                guidelines and budget allocation for 5 large events so the app
                wouldn’t be empty upon it’s inital launch.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our group and presented our idea to a group of digital media
                professors and the 2 business owners. We gave them our budget
                allocation and gave them the changes to the UI to focus the ease
                of a user getting in and getting out and they events the user
                would go to. Turns out it was a pretty great solution and we
                ended up winning the competition.
